BSL430.NET.GUI App
------------------
BSL430.NET.GUI App is .NET WPF app wrapping BSL430.NET functions with nice graphical interface. It is Windows only, so if you run Linux, you should check out [Console App](https://github.com/parezj/BSL430.NET/wiki/BSL430.NET.Console-App). For more details please read docs here at wiki [BSL430.NET Library](https://github.com/parezj/BSL430.NET/wiki/BSL430.NET.Library) or [FirmwareTools](https://github.com/parezj/BSL430.NET/wiki/BSL430.NET.FirmwareTools.Library), especially [**Device Set Up**](https://github.com/parezj/BSL430.NET/wiki/BSL430.NET.Library#Device-Set-Up), because each time you init communication with MCU, you need to correctly set device up (*MCU*, *InvokeMechanism*, *BaudRate*, *Password*). App functionality is split into *Views*: **Upload**, **Download**, **Erase** and **FW Tools**. There are also some nice *features* included, like integration with Windows Explorer (Shell) in form of **shell ext association** (firmware files double click open), or **shell extension** (right click menu). App **settings** are managed from tray icon.

```
Note: This app packs all (un)managed libraries into single assembly.
      User settings, logs, log backup and exe shadow copy are stored at: 
      C:\Users\<NAME>\AppData\Local\Jakub Parez\BSL430.NET.WPF\

System Requirements
-------------------
BSL430.NET.WPF is built using **.NET Framework 4.6.1**. NET Core 3 (WPF) support is only experimental and would be interesting after .NET Core and WPF will go out better than today (.NET Core 3.0 Preview is first to implement WPF but not fully and without problems). Each architecture (x86, amd64) has its own build as unmanaged libraries are involved, but there are no significant differences when using x86 or amd64 build.
- Framework
  - .NET Framework 4.6.1
  - *.NET Core 3.0 (experimental)*
- OS
  - Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10
    - x86
    - amd64

### Scan
Scan for available devices. It is important to have drivers installed for using FTDI devices (FTD2XX). If you dont want to or cant install them, please use libftdi. Other device types are USB or Serial (COM) port.

### Upload
Uploading code to micro is the most common way how use this library. First device needs to be set up (MCU family, Invoke Method, Baud Rate) according to [docs](https://github.com/parezj/BSL430.NET/wiki/BSL430.NET.Library#Device-Set-Up). Then You need to select **firmware file path** in formats Intel-HEX, TI-TXT, SREC or ELF. Password, key to unlock bootloader, is here optional, because mostly you want dont know it and also doesnt care about that data, because they are being overwriten with new one. However there are two use cases, when good password matters. First, you already uploaded main firmware to your device and now you want to upload only Info A memory (user settings, constants..). In this case you dont want to Erase MCU first, so you need to supply valid BSL password. Secondly, read warning below:
```
Warning: Password is optional for Download, but if wrong password is entered, 
         MCU takes it as an attack and erase all memory, executing Mass Erase.
         If modern 5xx/6xx micro is used, code is just wiped, but if old
         1xx/2xx/4xx one is used and LOCK A bit is not set, also Info A mem
         is wiped, with factory calibration data. So please be careful.
```

### Download
Downloading code from micro is useful only sometimes, like when solving a problem with some remote device. First device needs to be set up (MCU family, Invoke Method, Baud Rate) according to [docs](https://github.com/parezj/BSL430.NET/wiki/BSL430.NET.Library#Device-Set-Up). Then You need to select firmware destination path and output format. Also **Start Addr** and **Byte Size** settings are crucial, which are the address of the very first data node wanted, and the count of bytes downloaded. You can toggle the button **K/1** and switch between scaler of download range. If *1* is set, values are in standard decimal units 1:1, if *K* is set, values are multiplied by 1024. Password is key to unlock bootloader and needs to be set correctly, otherwise bad things happen. Read below.
```
Warning: Password is needed for Download. If wrong password is entered, MCU 
         takes it as an attack and erase all memory, executing Mass Erase.
         If modern 5xx/6xx micro is used, code is just wiped, but if old
         1xx/2xx/4xx one is used and LOCK A bit is not set, also Info A mem
         is wiped, with factory calibration data. So please be careful.

### Erase
Erasing micro is also sometimes needed and doesnt require any input data, nor it cares about set Baud Rate value. Just call this method and quickly all memory is erased. Device needs to be set up first (MCU family, Invoke Method, Baud Rate) according to [docs](https://github.com/parezj/BSL430.NET/wiki/BSL430.NET.Library#Device-Set-Up).
```
Warning: If old 1xx/2xx/4xx MCU is used and LOCK A bit is not set **DONT** do it!
         Info A memory will be erased as well, with factory calibration data.
         This will also happen when incorrect password entered, so be careful.
         Or just dont use old micros and buy a new better one :)

### XML Log
All main operations are logged into XML file located at *C:\Users\<NAME>\AppData\Local\Jakub Parez\BSL430.NET.WPF\*. You can open this log file by embedded explorer (AvalonEdit) by clicking *XML Log* or you cant just simply navigate into that folder by file explorer. If log file grows larger than 2MB, after app start you will be notified of moving this file to backup folder at same location and creating a new blank one.

### Firmware Tools
This view implements all main functionality of sub-package **BSL430.NET.FirmwareTools**. These functions are universal except of *Get Password*, which is MSP430 specific. First there needs to be chosen (first) firmware file path.

#### Convert
Convert firmware TI-TXT, Intel-HEX or ELF format (auto detected) to firmware in TI-TXT, Intel-HEX or SREC format. There needs to be set output firmware format by combo-box and after clicking *Convert* button dialog windows opens. There is set output file path and optional check-box FillFF can be set (fill missing addr nodes with 0xFF and return monolithic piece of code). LineLength can be set via Tray Icon settings and it defines amount of data bytes per one text row. When = 0, default values are set (TI-TXT = 16, Intel-HEX = 32, SREC = 32).
